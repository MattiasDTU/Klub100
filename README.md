This program enables users to create or edit an Excel file named "Data.xlsx", where they can input multiple YouTube video URLs (individual videos only, no playlists). For each video, users can specify:

Start Time: The exact time to begin downloading the video Audio.

End Time: The precise point to stop downloading the video Audio.

Additionally, the program offers an optional feature to append custom text-to-speech audio to the end of each downloaded video. At the end it will collect all video audios into a single file (Currently this is a must! If there isnt a custom TTS, it will crash :^) )

**It takes time to run! This is to insure that the audio is balanced and doesn't destroy your speaker!**
## Conditions that must be met ##
You must have FFmpeg downloaded on your system and attached to your paths. Go to "FFmpeq Tutorial.md" to see how to install and add to path.
